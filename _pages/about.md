I am a computer science Ph.D. candidate at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel, under the advisement of Prof. Gera Weiss and Dr. Achiya Elyasaf. 

My research specializes in the Behavioral Programming (BP) paradigm, focusing on its application in software development, reactive systems, and requirements modeling. This work centers on enhancing the alignment of system implementations with their requirements by proposing new methodologies and tools that combine BP, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and formal methods. Through this research, I aim to create a comprehensive toolbox for developers, offering a rich, multifaceted development process that is rigorous and adaptable to the evolving needs of modern software systems.


**Research Interests:**
- Behavioral Programming
- Requirements Engineering
- Large Language Models
- Reinforcement Learning
- Formal Methods
- Petri nets
