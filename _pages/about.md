I am a computer science Ph.D. candidate under the advisement of Prof. Gera Weiss at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel. I received my B.Sc. (Magna cum laude) in industrial engineering and management and my M.Sc. (summa cum laude) in computer science. My current research involves the application of machine learning algorithms to software engineering practices and disciplines.
<!-- Tom received several fellowships, including deanâ€™s list -->
