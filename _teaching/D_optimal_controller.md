This software enables optimal control of microstructure's evolution through coupling phase-field models with reinforcement learning algorithms. The microstructure can be guided from any initial, unstructured state to any target state with the least cost. Please refer to the [examples](https://maozirui.github.io/portfolio/B1_Optimal%20control/).
