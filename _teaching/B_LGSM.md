The L-GSM platform provides a <u>meshfree</u> method for handling <u>large deformation problems</u> with a much better performance in stability and efficiency. Applications can be found [here](https://maozirui.github.io/portfolio/A1_Meshfee%20methods%20for%20large-deformation%20problems/). The in-house code will be released as planned.
